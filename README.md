# Hungry and Indecisive 

## User Story

We wanted to create an application which would help users come up with fun new recipe ideas when they just have a general idea of what they want to eat.

Since many people have some dietary restrictions that they need to work around when planning meals or snacks, we wanted to provide the fun of looking through new recipe ideas while incorporating filters to eliminate foods that a user is unable or unwilling to eat. This ensures that all of the suggested recipes are limited to options each user will be able to enjoy.

## Tools Used
We used Spoonacular (https://spoonacular.com/food-api/docs) as an API resource to search for recipes. We incorporated search parameters that were available within Spoonacular's API to allow users to search for different types of cuisine and to select whether they were looking for foods for different meals or just a snack. We included search parameters to exlude various allergens, such as soy, or intolerances such as gluten that a user selects. We also wanted users to be able to generate recipes that fit with their overall dietary structure, so we included a filter allowing users who are vegetarian or following other overall dietary patterns to only receive recipes that followed those dietary guidelines.

We used the Nutrition Ninja API (https://rapidapi.com/apininjas/api/nutrition-by-api-ninjas) to incorporate calorie information regarding the recipes provided to allow users to make more informed choices regarding the recipe options.

We leveraged Metro UI as the framework for this application. As a framework new to all the team members, it was an adjustment learning how to leverage the different functionalities. Additionally, tying in the API funtions with the rest of the structure was also a learning opportunity for the team.

## Growth Potential
If an expansion of functionalities were desired in the future, the numerous API functionalities provided by Spoonacular would provide ample opportunities to expand the application's functions and allow for additional inputs to be implemented.
